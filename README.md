# ðŸ“Š Accounting Ledger Application

## What This Project Is About

I built this command-line application to help track financial transactions - basically deposits and payments. Everything gets saved to a CSV file so your data sticks around even after you close the app. This was my first capstone project for the Year Up Java Development program, and I learned a ton building it!

The main idea is pretty simple: you can add money coming in (deposits), record money going out (payments), and then view everything in different ways through reports. It's like a mini accounting system that runs right in your terminal.

---

## What It Can Do

### Main Menu (Home Screen)
When you start the app, you get four options:
- **Add Deposit** - Record money coming in (like paychecks or payments from clients)
- **Make Payment** - Record money going out (automatically makes it negative)
- **Ledger** - View all your transactions in different ways
- **Exit** - Close the app

### The Ledger
Once you're in the ledger, you can:
- See all your entries sorted by date (newest first)
- Filter to see only deposits (the positive ones)
- Filter to see only payments (the negative ones)
- Jump into the reports section
- Go back to the home screen

### Reports Section
This is where it gets more useful. You can:
- **Month To Date** - See everything from the start of this month until today
- **Previous Month** - View the entire last month's transactions
- **Year To Date** - Check out everything from January 1st until now
- **Previous Year** - Look at last year's full transaction history
- **Search by Vendor** - Find all transactions with a specific company or person
- **Custom Search** - This is the challenge feature I added! You can search by date range, description, vendor, or amount. Leave anything blank to skip that filter.

## What I Used to Build This

- **Java** - The main programming language
- **LocalDate & LocalTime** - Java's built-in classes for handling dates and times
- **ArrayList** - To store and manage all the transactions
- **File I/O** - Reading from and writing to the CSV file
- **Scanner** - Getting input from the user

---

## How to Run It

If you want to try this out yourself:

1. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or newer)
2. Clone this repo or download the files
3. Open it in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)
4. Find `AccountingLedgerApp.java` in the src folder
5. Right-click and hit Run
6. Follow the menu prompts!

The CSV file will be created automatically the first time you add a transaction.

---

## About the CSV File

All transactions get saved to `transactions.csv` in this format:
```
date|time|description|vendor|amount
```

Here's what some actual entries look like:
```csv
2025-10-16|14:30|Account Check|Walmart|1.00
2025-10-16|15:00|First Paycheck|CVS|1000.00
2024-10-10|15:45|Office supplies|Staples|-75.25
```

**Quick notes:**
- Deposits are positive numbers
- Payments are negative numbers
- The `|` symbol separates each piece of info
- Dates look like: `2025-10-16` (year-month-day)
- Times look like: `15:00:00` (military time)

## The Most Interesting Part of My Code

The coolest thing I figured out was how to filter transactions by date ranges. I use this same logic in all the report methods:
```java
// Check if transaction date falls within our date range
if ((transaction.getDate().isEqual(startOfPreviousMonth) || transaction.getDate().isAfter(startOfPreviousMonth)) &&
    (transaction.getDate().isEqual(endOfPreviousMonth) || transaction.getDate().isBefore(endOfPreviousMonth))) {
    // If it does, print it out
    System.out.printf("%-12s %-10s %-25s %-20s %10.2f\n",
            transaction.getDate(),
            transaction.getTime(),
            transaction.getDescription(),
            transaction.getVendor(),
            transaction.getAmount());
}
```

**Why I think this is interesting:**

At first, I thought I'd just check if a date was after the start and before the end. But then I realized - what about transactions that happen exactly on the first or last day of the month? They'd get missed!

So I had to use `isEqual()` along with `isAfter()` and `isBefore()`. The logic basically says:
- Is the transaction on or after the start date? **AND**
- Is the transaction on or before the end date?

Both conditions have to be true for it to show up in the report.

We actually learned a method called `isWithinRange()` in the workbook that does this exact thing, but I decided to write it out directly in each method so I could see exactly what was happening. It made debugging way easier!

## What I Learned

This project really helped me understand:
- How to design classes and use objects (the Transaction class)
- Working with dates and times in Java
- Reading and writing files (the CSV stuff was tricky at first!)
- Using ArrayLists to store and organize data
- Sorting data (I used bubble sort to show newest transactions first)
- Building menus that are easy to use
- Handling errors when users type something wrong

The date filtering was probably the hardest part, but once I got it working it felt really good because I could reuse the same pattern everywhere.

---

## Extra Features I Added

I completed the challenge requirements:
- âœ… **Custom Search** - You can filter by start date, end date, description, vendor, and amount all at once
- âœ… **Nice-Looking Interface** - Used those fancy box-drawing characters to make it look professional
- âœ… **Lots of Comments** - I tried to explain not just what the code does, but why I did it that way

---

## What I'd Do Differently Next Time

Looking back, there are a few things I might change:
- Create a helper method for the date range filtering instead of copying the same code
- Add more input validation (like making sure amounts are actually numbers)
- Maybe add a way to edit or delete transactions
- Use better variable names in some spots

But overall I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!
